need to add the following elements:

=item * libris_sigil - The sigil used to identify the library in Libris.

=item * libris_key - The API key for talking to the Libris API.

=item * unknown_patron - borrowernumber for a dummy patron that can be used
if a connection to a real patron can not be established.

=item * unknown_biblio - biblionumber of a dummy record that can be used
if a connection to a real biblio can not be established.
