=head1 CONFIGURATION

Some tips on how to configure the Libris ILL backend.

=head2 System preferences

=over 4

=item * B<ILLModule> = Enable

=item * Use B<OpacHiddenItems> to hide the itemtypes given in B<ill_itemtype> and
B<ill_closed_itemtype> below from the OPAC. E.g.: "itype: [FJARRLAN, FJARRLANX]".

=head2 koha-conf.xml

In this file you need to make sure you have set up a section called 
interlibrary_loans for the ILL stuff to work at all. Inside this section, you
need to add the following elements: 

=over 4

=item * B<libris_sigil> - The sigil used to identify the library in Libris.

=item * B<libris_key> - The API key for talking to the Libris API. Swedish
libraries can look this up when they are logged into Libris.

=item * B<unknown_patron> - borrowernumber for a dummy patron that can be used
if a connection to a real patron can not be established.

=item * B<unknown_biblio> - biblionumber of a dummy record that can be used
if a connection to a real biblio can not be established.

=item * B<ill_branch> - Library to tie imported dta about libraries to.

=item * B<ill_itemtype> - When items are created for ILL documents, use this
itemtype.

=item * B<ill_closed_itemtype> - Use this itemtype when an ILL is marked as
done. If you do not want to differentiate between items that are done and
items that are not done, set this to the same value as ill_itemtype.

=item * B<libris_borrowernumber> - A "fake" patron that can be used to add
automatic ILL comments.

Example: 

  <yazgfs>
    <config>
      <interlibrary_loans>
        ...
        <libris_sigil>xyz</libris_sigil>
        <libris_key>abc</libris_key>
        <libris_borrowernumber>123</libris_borrowernumber>
        <unknown_patron>1</unknown_patron>
        <unknown_biblio>2</unknown_biblio>
        <ill_branch>FJARRLAN</ill_branch>
        <ill_itemtype>FJARRLAN</ill_itemtype>
        <ill_closed_itemtype>FJARRLANX</ill_closed_itemtype>
      </interlibrary_loans>
    <config>
  <yazgfs>

=head2 Notices

Add notices with the following codes under Tools > Notices and slips:

=over 4

=item * B<ILL_ANK_LAN> - For books and other media that are borrowed and returned.

=item * B<ILL_ANK_KOPIA> - For article copies that are not returned.

=back

The following settings should apply to all notices:

=over 4

=item * B<Library>: All libraries

=item * B<Koha module>: Circulation

=back

FIXME: Suggest content for the messages.

=head2 Cron jobs

See "perldoc cron/get_data_from_libris.pl" for details.

=head2 Tips and tricks

=head3 Hide the "Create a new request" button in OPAC

Libris ILL does not allow patrons to create requests from the OPAC, so we can
just hide this button, by adding the following to the OPACUserCSS syspref:

  #ill-backend-dropdown { display: none; }

=head3 Hide some ILL metadata elements in the OPAC

Elements under "Details from library" can be hidden with OPACUserJS:

  .requestattr-Melding  { display: none; }
  .requestattr-Libris   { display: none; }

Elements under "Details from Libris" can be hidden with OPACUserCSS:

  $("label[for='backend']").parent().hide();
  $("label[for='medium']").parent().hide();
  $("label[for='placed']").parent().hide();
